In classification problems -
    the values are 0/1
    so the linear line to predict cannot work
    we need a logistic regression curve
        as it starts at 0 , raises and becomes parallel at 1 again
        phi(z) = 1/(1+e^(-z))
        
    
    linear exp:
        y = bo+b1x
        
    corresponding logistical exp:
        p = 1/(1+(e^-(bo+b1.x)))
        
        divide the part of function at 0.5(approx):
            below - 0
            above - 1
            
confusion matrix:
    is use to evaluate the model
    index - atcual yes/no
    columns - predicted yes/no
    the cells contain the no of instances each occur
    
    values:
    true positive
    true negative
    false positive - type 1 error
    false negative - type 2 error
    
    accuracy:
        (TN+TP)/total
    
    misclassification rate/error rate:
        (FP+FN)/total
