decision tree:
    dividing the data into a tree with the nodes denoting the attribute
    the leaf node is yes/no
    
    entropy and information gain can be calculated
    
random forest:
    To improve performance,we use multiple trees with
        random set of m attributes from p total attributes
        
        for classification: m is typically chosen to be square root of p
